## 🤖 ChatGPT Prompt Example for Experience Sections  

For **ATS-friendly** (Applicant Tracking System) resume bullet points, use this structure:  

📌 **"Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]."**  

Example:  
✅ **"Increased server query response time by 15% by restructuring the API."**  

### 🔹 Best Practices for Bullet Points  
✔ Keep descriptions **concise and clear**.  
✔ Use **strong action verbs** like *created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed*.  
✔ Avoid bullet points that spill onto the next line by **just 1-2 words**.

## 🎤 STAR Method Interview Example  

The **STAR Method** is a structured approach to answering behavioral interview questions. It stands for **Situation, Task, Action, and Result**.  

### Example Question: *"Tell me about a time you solved a challenging problem at work."*  

✅ **Situation**: In my previous role as a software engineer, our team faced a critical bug in production that was affecting 30% of users.
✅ **Task**: My responsibility was to identify the root cause and deploy a fix within 24 hours.
✅ **Action**: I analyzed logs, reproduced the issue in a staging environment, and discovered that a recent API update had introduced a breaking change. I implemented a rollback and coordinated with the API provider for a long-term fix.
✅ **Result**: The issue was resolved within 12 hours, reducing customer complaints by 90% and improving system stability.  

Use this structure to effectively answer behavioral interview questions! 🎯
